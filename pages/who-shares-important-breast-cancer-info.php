                <p>The WHO released a fact sheet <strong><span>about Breast Cancer</span></strong> and discussed their Global Breast Cancer Initiative (GBCI)</p>
                <p>The objective of the WHO Global Breast Cancer Initiative (GBCI) is to <strong><span>reduce global breast cancer mortality</span></strong> by 2.5% per year, thereby <strong><span>averting 2.5 million breast cancer deaths globally</span></strong> between 2020 and 2040.</p>
                <p>This vital initiative seeks to increase breast cancer education and encourage referrals to diagnostic services when appropriate.</p>
                <p>Another important aspect of breast cancer is <span><strong>better non-invasive cancer treatments.</strong></span></p>
                <p>While there are different studies addressing the root causes of the cancer epidemic, the need for <span><strong>better, more advanced treatments fuels CancerVax and the team of researchers.</strong></span></p>
                <p>CancerVax believes the <span><strong>future of cancer treatment is immunotherapy.</strong></span></p>
                <p>Because of the potential of immunotherapy, <span><strong>CancerVax has a valuable Sponsored Research Agreement with UCLA</strong></span> to develop universal cancer treatments that will precisely detect, mark and kill cancer cells, while leaving healthy cells intact.</p>
                <p>According to Bloomberg Business, the <span><strong>cancer immunotherapy market is expected to grow to $196 billion by 2030.</strong></span>&nbsp;</p>
                <p>We invite you to <span><strong>help us in the fight against cancer by investing in CancerVax.</strong></span></p>
