                <p>A new National Institute of Health (NIH) study outlines opportunities to achieve President Biden’s Cancer Moonshot goal of <strong><span>reducing cancer death rates in the United States.</span></strong></p>
                <p>This ambitious goal of <span><strong>cutting the age-adjusted cancer death rate by at least 50%</strong></span> over 25 years is heavily reliant on innovation and cancer research.</p>
                <p>The publication of this study coincides with the release of the National Cancer Plan, <span><strong>a long-term, ambitious framework developed to support a national response&nbsp;</strong></span>to achieving the goals of the Cancer Moonshot.</p>
                <p>This <span><strong>push by the White House to reduce cancer death rates is driving developments</strong></span> in cancer treatment.</p>
                <p>The CancerVax approach, using immunotherapy to harness the body's immune system to treat cancer, is seen as<span><strong>&nbsp;a powerful tool in this fight.</strong></span></p>
                <p>The strong public/private alliance in the battle against cancer is creating <span><strong>a significant opportunity for investors.</strong></span></p>
