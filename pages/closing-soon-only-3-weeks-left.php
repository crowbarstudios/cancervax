                <p>Hello Supporters,</p>
                <p>We thank you for your interest and investment in our offering at StartEngine.</p>
                <p>Our work with the team at UCLA has been mind blowing and has exceeded our expectations.</p>
                <p>We chose UCLA because it is one of the TOP cancer research institutions full of oncologists and researchers who are pushing the boundaries on what is possible with cancer treatment.</p>
                <p>Currently, over 100 types of cancers exist. In 2015 approximately $183 billion was spent on cancer health care, in the U.S. alone; that number is projected to grow to $246 billion by 2030.</p>
                <p>The exciting progress by the UCLA research team has caused strong support, excitement, and growing investments from our private investors. As a result, we have decided to close the current Reg A+ offering at StartEngine early on November 7, 2023.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>CancerVax has 3 viable pathways of growth with its current research program.</p>
                <ul class="[&>li]:text-sm [&>li]:tracking-[.05px] list-disc pl-10 my-6">
                    <li>A disease specific cancer treatment targeting Ewing Sarcoma, a deadly bone and soft tissue cancer that primarily affects young children.</li>
                    <li>The Universal Cancer Treatment Platform (“UCV”) designed to treat multiple cancers and create a better way to treat cancer.</li>
                    <li>A powerful UCV plus mRNA technology that can be adapted to perform CAR-T cell treatments at a fraction of the cost of existing approaches. We call this the Universal CAR-T Cell Platform.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><br></p>
                <p>We look forward to what the future brings and would like you to join us. The feedback on social media and with our current supporters has been moving. We understand the responsibility entrusted to us for all the lives touched by cancer and this reality pushes the team every day.</p>
                <p><br></p>
