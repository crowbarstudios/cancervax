                <p>In a recent video, <strong><span>CancerVax CEO Ryan Davies explained the typical process of how small biotech companies become successful</span></strong> by selling or licensing its technology to Big Pharma.</p>
                <p>Big Pharma’s use of small biotech companies as research and development arms is very common and it is why many smaller companies have potential profitability.</p>
                <p>Ryan explains, “It’s typically less expensive for big companies to buy or license technology from small biotech companies like CancerVax.”</p>
                <p>The ability for a company like CancerVax to quickly deploy resources without the bureaucracy of a large corporation makes them nimble and often successful researchers.</p>
                <p>This strategy is at the heart of what makes CancerVax such an attractive company and groundfloor investment opportunity. <strong><span>We don't need to complete Phase 3 clinical trials for CancerVax to be valuable.</span></strong>&nbsp; Every step of technical success along the way is a jump in value.</p>
                <p>CancerVax is working on revolutionizing cancer treatment by using the body's immune system to treat cancer.</p>
