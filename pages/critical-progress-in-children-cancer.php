                <p>Recently, the UCLA team <strong><span>successfully developed 7 antibody candidates</span></strong> in their vital research into Ewing sarcoma, a deadly form of children’s cancer.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Six (6) of the <strong><span>antibody candidates</span></strong> have been fully humanized with confirmed targeting affinity for Ewing sarcoma, two (2) of which will be used to develop CAR T-cell treatments, and three (3) of the others will be manufactured into bispecific antibodies.</p>
                <p>This is exciting and important because Ewing sarcoma is an <strong><span>aggressive bone and soft-tissue cancer</span></strong> with limited chances of cure, that <strong><span>primarily affects children</span></strong>. &nbsp;</p>
                <p>Current therapies for Ewing sarcoma have reached a plateau over the last several decades, and there is an urgent need for improved outcomes.</p>
                <p>CancerVax is working with a team of <strong><span>highly experienced pediatric oncologists/scientists at UCLA</span></strong> to develop a cancer immunotherapy treatment that uses the body’s immune system to attack Ewing sarcoma.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>We’re excited to be <strong><span>moving into the tissue testing phase soon!</span></strong></p>
                <p><br></p>
