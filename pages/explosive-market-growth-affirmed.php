                <p>A recent Global Newswire report highlighted the growth of the cancer immunotherapy market and the explosive trends.</p>
                <p>The global <strong><span>cancer immunotherapy market is expected to reach $674 billion</span></strong> by 2032.</p>
                <p>This is due to the need for better cancer treatments and increase in research developments.</p>
                <p>The CancerVax approach is seen as a powerful tool in this fight.</p>
                <p>Recent trends suggest that worldwide by 2040, the number of <strong><span>n</span></strong><strong><span>ew cancer cases per year is expected to rise to 29.5 million</span></strong>.</p>
                <p>Because of the potential of immunotherapy, CancerVax has a valuable Sponsored Research Agreement with UCLA to develop a <strong><span>universal cancer treatment that will precisely detect, mark and kill cancer cells, while leaving healthy cells intact</span></strong>.</p>
                <p>“Current cancer treatments are invasive and offer troubling side effects,” states Byron Elton, CMO of CancerVax and recent cancer survivor.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>“Our work will revolutionize the cancer treatment landscape as we bring hope to millions of patients around the world and future generations.” Byron emphasizes.&nbsp;</p>
