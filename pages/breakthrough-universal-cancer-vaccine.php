                <p id="isPasted">The biotech industry isn’t for the faint of heart. &nbsp;And that’s why Ryan Davies jumped at the chance to lead <strong><span>CancerVax, a high-stakes, pre-clinical biotech company working with UCLA to develop immunotherapy cancer treatments&nbsp;</span></strong>that will use the body’s immune system to treat cancer. &nbsp;</p>
                <p><br></p>
                <p><strong><span>CancerVax’s mission is to develop a breakthrough universal cancer treatment.&nbsp;</span></strong></p>
                <p><br></p>
                <p>According to Bloomberg Business,<strong><span>&nbsp;the cancer immunotherapy market is expected to grow to $196 billion by 2030</span></strong>. &nbsp;Davies believes immunotherapy drugs like Merck’s Keytruda and Opdivo from Briston-Meyers Squibb, which started out as niche products and became blockbusters with multiple cancer indications, are <strong><span>proof that not only is immunotherapy a growing and successful market, but also an opportunity for hope for cancer patients.</span></strong></p>
