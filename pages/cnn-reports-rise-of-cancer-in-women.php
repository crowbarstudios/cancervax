                <p>CNN warned women about a <strong><span>rise in cancer diagnosis</span></strong> in a recent article.</p>
                <p>A government-funded study of 17 National Cancer Institute registries, published Wednesday in the journal JAMA Network Open, looked at more than 500,000 cases of early-onset cancer, or cancers diagnosed in patients under age 50, between 2010 and 2019.</p>
                <p>This study found a<strong><span>&nbsp;troubling increase in cancer in women.</span></strong></p>
                <p>These increases are not confined to the US, studies say. A review of cancer registry records in 44 countries, published last year, found that th<span style="font-size: 14px;">e i</span><span style="font-size: 14px;">ncidence of early-onset cancers is&nbsp;</span><strong><span>rising rapidly for 14 types of cancer,</span></strong> many of which affect the digestive system.</p>
                <p>These findings are consistent with other reports that suggest that worldwide by 2040, the number of new <strong><span>cancer cases per year is expected to rise to 29.5 million.</span></strong></p>
                <p>This presents a <strong><span>unique challenge and opportunity.</span></strong></p>
                <p><strong><span>CancerVax is revolutionizing cancer treatment</span></strong> using the body's immune system to treat cancer.</p>
