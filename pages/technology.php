                    <p>Our revolutionary approach <strong>DETECTS, MARKS</strong>, and <strong>KILLS</strong> only cancer cells. By making cancer cells look like well-immunized diseases, such as measles, we intend to “trick” the body’s immune system into killing cancer cells. Anyone who has had measles or been vaccinated for it, has strong lifetime immunity to the disease. This immunity kills anything that looks like measles immediately upon re-exposure. </p>

                    <p>Unlike conventional immunotherapies that try to “teach” the immune system how to recognize cancer cells, our approach is a <strong>paradigm shift</strong> that “tricks” the immune system.
                    </p>
                    <p>We believe that teaching the immune system is as difficult as “teaching an old dog a new trick.” Instead, we trick the dog into doing something that it knows how to do very well. In the case of the immune system, that’s killing measles.

                    </p>

                    <p>Our novel approach is a fundamentally different way of thinking about fighting cancer. After countless lives have been lost to cancer, <strong>tricking the immune system may be just what the doctors needed</strong>.</p>

            <p class="text-black text-xl font-normal pb-5">Other immunotherapies such as personalized cancer vaccines, cytokine therapy or monoclonal antibodies often do not induce a strong enough immune response or last long enough to overwhelm cancer universally.</p>
            <p class="text-black text-xl font-normal pb-5">By “tricking” the body into mounting a strong initial immune response to cancer, like it does with measles, we believe there will be an enhanced immune memory-based secondary response to provide long-term remission.</p>

            <p class="text-black text-xl font-normal pb-5">Once a strong immune response is kicked off by the initial treatment, naïve B-cells and naïve T-cells will be so close to the battle that they will take a snapshot of the cancer neoantigens (proteins) and become memory B and T cells for future battles. This is a normal immune process called epitope spreading or immune broadening. The key to all of this is a strong initial immune response.
            </p>
            <p class="text-black text-xl font-normal pb-5">The weakness in other immunotherapies is the inability to induce a strong and lasting immune response. By tricking the body into mounting a strong response to measles, we believe the immune system will naturally “learn” what cancer looks like and will continue the fight against that cancer on its own. The new memory T-cells and B-cells can protect the body from future recurrences of the cancer, just like it does with measles.</p>

                    <p>One of the biggest challenges in immunotherapy, or using the body’s immune system to fight cancer, is that many tumors are considered “cold” tumors. A cold tumor is one that doesn't trigger an immune response. Cold tumors are often surrounded by cells that suppress the immune response, making them resistant to immunotherapy. Typical examples of cold tumors are pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, glioblastoma, and many breast cancers. </p>
                    <p>Checkpoint inhibitors such as Keytruda<sup>TM</sup>, the blockbuster drug from Merck<sup>TM</sup>, can sometimes “heat up” a tumor by blocking the mechanism that cancers use to evade the immune system (PD-1/PD-L1). But oftentimes, they cannot turn a cold tumor into a hot tumor so that it responds well to immunotherapy.</p>
                    <p>We believe that by going inside the cancer cell with our nanoparticle, confirming that it is a cancer cell with our Smart mRNA, then disguising the cell as measles, we can turn a cold tumor into a hot tumor because the body has a very strong immune response to measles. </p>
                    <p>Other immunotherapies have had very limited success trying to teach the immune system how to recognize cancer cells from the outside. Instead, we modify cancer cells from the inside and trick the body into seeing something it recognizes well. </p>
