                <p><strong><span>We just announced an expanded development pipeline with UCLA&nbsp;</span></strong>to include a low-cost Universal CAR-T Cell Platform.</p>
                <p>Remember the smart nanoparticle technology that UCLA developed for our Universal Cancer Treatment platform? &nbsp;Well… surprisingly, that highly customizable low-cost nanoparticle technology can potentially <span><strong>perform an existing cancer immunotherapy (CAR-T Cell) at an extremely low cost</strong></span>. &nbsp;Thus, the Universal CAR-T Cell Platform was born.</p>
                <p>CAR-T cell therapy is a type of FDA-approved immunotherapy in which a patient’s T-cells are genetically modified in the laboratory so they will bind to specific proteins (antigens) <strong><span>found on cancer cells and kill them.</span></strong> These modified T-cells are called Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T Cells.&nbsp;</p>
                <p>Conventional CAR-T Cell therapy can cost more than $500,000 per dose due to complicated and expensive lab processes. We believe we can potentially lower the cost to a few thousand dollars per dose by simply helping the body make its own CAR-T cells</p>
                <p>Instead of the time and expense of using external gene editing labs and other labs, we believe we can <strong><span>turn your body’s immune system into its own CAR-T cell factory,</span></strong> with a simple injection. &nbsp;</p>
                <p>Ryan Davies, our CEO commented, “While no amount of money is too much to save a single human life, we hope to dramatically lower the cost of CAR-T cell therapy by 100 times and help save many lives.”</p>
                <p><strong><span>We are extremely excited about this new development!</span></strong></p>
